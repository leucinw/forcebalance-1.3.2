# This is documentation for the ForceBalance condensed phase reference data file,,,,,,
"# Lines beginning with octothorpe are comments, empty lines are ignored",,,,,,
"# A line can either be a comment, a global parameter, a single line with column headings, or a data line (after the column heading line)",,,,,,
# This file should be saved as .xlsx (to preserve formatting) but exported to .csv for ForceBalance to use.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
"# Global parameters are defined here; they have ""Global"" in the first column.",,,,,,
# rho_denom : least squares denominator for the density objective function,,,,,,
"# Note: w_rho, w_hvap etc. is set in the input file.  This is because it's considered an adjustable option rather than a property of the data set.",,,,,,
# The overall prefactor for an observable is w_obs / obs_denom^2 ,,,,,,

"# Before entering the data, there must be one line with column headings.",,,,,,
# Allowed column headings are: (not case sensitive),,,,,,
# T : Temperature in Kelvin,,,,,,
"# P : Pressure in specified unit (append atm or bar), default is atm",,,,,,
# MBAR : Include this state in multistate Bennett acceptance ratio calculation (more extreme states are not included),,,,,,
# Rho : Density in kg m^-3,,,,,,
# Hvap : Enthalpy of vaporization in kJ/mol.  Note: simulating liquid at 1 atm is an acceptable approximation for the vapor pressure.,,,,,,
# Alpha : Thermal expansion coefficient in 10^-4 K^-1.,,,,,,
# Kappa: Isothermal compressibility in 10^-6 bar^-1.,,,,,,
# Cp: Isobaric heat capacity in kJ/mol K^-1.,,,,,,
# Eps0: Static dielectric constant.,,,,,,
# Rho_wt : Weight to use for this phase point. Analogous for Hvap etc. If column is missing then all weights are 1.,,,,,,
# Cvib_intra : To be ADDED to the calculated enthalpy of vaporization ; energy difference due to intramolecular vibrational frequency shifts in going from gas to liquid,,,,,,
# Cvib_inter : To be ADDED to the calculated enthalpy of vaporization ; energy difference due to intermolecular vibrational frequency shifts in going from gas to liquid,,,,,,
# Cni : To be ADDED to the calculated enthalpy of vaporization ; accounts for the nonideality of the gas phase (more relevant close to critical point),,,,,,
# dEvib : To be ADDED to the calculated heat capacity.  Note that these values are slightly different from the TIP4P-Ew paper for some reason.,,,,,,
