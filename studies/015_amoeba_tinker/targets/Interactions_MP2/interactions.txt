#                                                                  #
# Explanation for the formatting of this file			   #
# Anything after the octothrope (#) is a comment		   #
# Note to self: Please don't delete this section		   #
#								   #
# 1) The "$global" section contains settings that pertain to all   #
# systems, like the tinker .key file, which can be overrideen in   #
# the "$system" section.					   #
#								   #
# $global							   #
# keyfile water.key						   #
# $end								   #
#								   #
# 2) The "$system" section describes a system that is involved in  #
# the interaction energy.  Each system has a name and a geometry   #
# file that goes with it.  The name *must be a valid Python	   #
# variable name.*						   #
#								   #
# $system							   #
# name smith01							   #
# geometry smith01.xyz						   #
# keyfile smith01.key # This will override water.key		   #
# optimize            # The system will be geometry-optimized      #
# $end								   #
# 								   #
# Supplementary files like .key, .top and .mdp files 		   #
# can be specified here.  They should contain references 	   #
# to the force field file (.prm, .itp); the actual force field	   #
# file is unneeded as ForceBalance will create it.		   #
# 								   #
# 3) The "$interaction" section describes an interaction energy	   #
# between two systems.  Interactions can optionally have names,	   #
# if not provided then ForceBalance creates one.  The "energy"	   #
# keyword specifies the reference interaction energy (which can	   #
# come from high-level QM.)  The "equation" section describes	   #
# how the interaction is calculated by combining systems.	   #
# The variables in the equations are the system names, and the	   #
# syntax is identical to the Python language.  For example:	   #
#								   #
# $interaction							   #
# name Smith2							   #
# equation smith02 - 2*monomer_exp				   #
# energy -4.4528632 kilocalories_per_mole			   #
# $end								   #
# 								   #
# Here, the systems "smith02" and "monomer_exp" must be defined.   #
# ForceBalance has an internal energy dictionary that stores	   #
# the system energies computed from the force field; then it	   #
# uses 'exec' to actually create variables and functions 	   #
# with these names.						   #
# 								   #
# Future features:						   #
# 								   #
# We should allow the user to create a system from a		   #
# subset of another system.  For instance, we might		   #
# want to compute the interaction energy between molecules	   #
# in a cluster, but use the exact geometries in the cluster.	   #
# This should be done using a "from" keyword that specifies	   #
# the system from which this one is derived, and a "select" 	   #
# keyword using Python's selection syntax, such as:		   #
# 								   #
# $system							   #
# name my_second_water						   #
# from my_water_dimer # name of the parent system		   #
# select [3:6]        # for selecting atoms 4-6 (second molecule)  #
# $end								   #
# 								   #
# It should be possible to have an "optimize" keyword.  	   #
# This means that the system should be geometry-optimized 	   #
# (or TS-optimized) before the energy is computed.  Keep in mind   #
# that if all systems with the "optimize" keyword need to be 	   #
# optimized every time the objective function is evaluated.	   #
#								   #
# Furthermore, systems should optionally come with their own	   #
# absolute energies (which should not be fitted directly - rather  #
# they should be combined to yield interaction energies.)	   #
# 								   #

# S. S. Xantheas (personal communication), with exception of the 
# water monomer which was optimized in Molpro using MP2/aug-cc-pVTZ 
# following literature procedures.
