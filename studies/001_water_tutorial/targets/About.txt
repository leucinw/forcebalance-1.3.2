clusters-## : QM Energy and Force calculations on water clusters of various size containing three different types
of geometries:

1) Clusters extracted from simulation of a water-ice interface using the "Direct AMOEBA Revision 3" 
model at +/- 10 degrees around the melting point (255 K).

2) Clusters extracted from simulation of liquid water using the original AMOEBA model at 243 - 373 K.

3) Minimum energy clusters, minimized using MP2/aTZ.

All QM force calculations performed with DB-RIMP2/haTZ.
